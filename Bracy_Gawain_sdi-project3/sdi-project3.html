<p>The Theme that I chose is, "What type of tracks will I make for Ciara". I chose this 
because it relates to what I do as a profession and I feel is a good match in seeing how 
it can relate to Javascript.</p>
<p>My current career consists of composing music for major recording artists. My current project is with Ciara. While working on this project I came to realization of how variables can come into play while creating music for her. I am making a decision on whether I will do Urban R&B tracks or Pop R&B tracks.</p>
 
<p>For starters, when I begin making a track I either begin with a melody or a drum pattern. If I start with a melody then usually the instrumental will result in a melodic progressive driven composition and the drums will complement that melody which is found more often in todays top 40 pop music. If I chose to start a drum pattern first in most cases the instrumental will be drum driven and the melody will be simple and will complement those drums which is found in today's urban R&B music. Typically it takes a shorter amount of time to compose an Urban R&B track averaging 2 hours.</p>
 
<p>Once I decide which route I will take, I decide what type of drums will be used for the instrumental. Depending my drum choice will place the instrumental in a musical genre. If I choose more bass heavy (808) drums sounds the instrumental can be categorized as urban. If I choose more organic/reverb drums the instrumental will be categorized as pop. Typically it takes a longer amount of time to compose a Pop R&B track averaging 4 hours.
</p>
 
<p>I would like at least 2 records on the album. In accomplishing this goal I will create 4 more instrumentals than needed for the project for variety purposes, with a total of 6.</p>
 
<p>While making the intial tracks I began creating. Ciara made a decision to do a combination of 1 Urban R&b and 1 Pop R&b track for the two tracks needed for her album.</p>
